<p>I'll update this page with something more prosaic. But in the meantime here's a statement from my CV:</p>

<p>
I am a Software Developer specialising in ASP.NET MVC web applications. I have worked extensively in Agile environments, writing large enterprise applications using Test and Behaviour Driven Design following good Object Orientated and SOLID principles and design patterns.</p>
<p>
As a Microsoft Certified Professional Developer and a Professional Scrum Master I maintain the desire to share my knowledge whilst still learning and developing my skills with the latest web application technologies. I have a logical and analytical approach to solving complex problems and issues and work well on my own initiative.</p>
